-------------------key lost task---------------------

Steps - Initial Setup

1. Launch two Amazon Linux ec2 instances with t2.micro, Public IP enabled And Same Avaibility Zone.

2. Ensure that both instances use different AWS Keypairs

3. Enable port 22 for SSH on the both instances

4. Name Instance 1 as server Instance and its attached Root EBS volume as sever Volume

5. Name Instance 2 as client Instance and its attached Root EBS volume as client Volume

Note-lets assume that we have lost the private key for our client Instance.

Steps -

1. Stop your client EC2 (client) instance

2. Detach the Root volume from the client instance

3. Attach client Volume to the server instance (insure that your server instance is start)

4. connect your server instance or take ssh.

5. Isblk --> cheake your volumes

6. sudo mkdir /mnt/tempvol

7. sudo mount -o nouuid /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/tempvol
   (xvdf1 is your client volume name in server instance)

8. cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/tempvol/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys

9. sudo cd /mnt/tempvol/home/ec2-user/.ssh  --> for confirmation key copy or not

10. sudo umount /mnt/tempvol

11. Detach the client volume from the server instance

12. Re-attach the client volume to the client instance as the root volume
    (must asure that when attach root volume give name xvda )

13. Start the Original instance and connect to the Original instance using the key pair of your server instance
