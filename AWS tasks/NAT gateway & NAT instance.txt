||*|| NAT gateway & NAT instance ||*||

#NAT gateway

 - create 2 subnet in same VPC-1 ( 1-public 1-private)

 - create IG internet gateway.attached with VPC-1
 
 - create pub-rout table & associate with pub-subnet & rout with IG internet getway.

 - create nat gateway.(create in pub-subnet work for privet sub)
 
 - create privet-rout table & associate with privet-subnet & rout with NAT getway.

 - create 1 EC2 server in pub-subnet & allow public IP. (in SG= allow ssh,http,all ICMP IPv4 ports)
  
 - create 1 EC2 server in prive-subnet &  don't allow public IP.
 
 - open pub-EC2 with the help of ssh & ping private Ec2 with ( # ping <private EC2 IP> )
    (it is ping because of in same VPC)
   ->take ssh of private-EC2 from pub EC2 (ssh -i <private key> ec2-user<private IP>)
   ->ping 8.8.8.8 (internet check)
     If it ping it means your NAt getway works

#NAT instance

 - create 2 subnet in same VPC-1 ( 1-public 1-private)

 - create IG internet gateway.attached with VPC-1
 
 - create pub-rout table & associate with pub-subnet & rout with IG internet getway.

 - create NAT instance in pub-subnet.
   ->launch inst -browse AMI -Community AMI -search nat -select first AMI -enable pub IP
 
 - create privet-rout table & associate with privet-subnet & rout with NAT instance.

 - create 1 EC2 server in pub-subnet & allow public IP. (in SG= allow ssh,http,all ICMP IPv4 ports)
  
 - create 1 EC2 server in prive-subnet &  don't allow public IP.
 
 - open pub-EC2 with te help of ssh & ping private Ec2 with ( # ping <private EC2 IP> )
    (it is ping because of in same VPC)
   ->take ssh of private-EC2 from pub EC2 (ssh -i <private key> ec2-user<private IP>)
   ->ping 8.8.8.8 (internet check)
     If it ping it means your NAt inst works
 
 - if not :
   ->go to NAT EC@ inst -Action -Networking -change source/dest chsnge -stop[*] & save.
