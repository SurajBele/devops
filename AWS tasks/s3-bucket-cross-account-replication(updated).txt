--> s3 bucket cross account replication (just like iam user role for access bucket)
     
       a. source account side -
         1. create bucket with object 
         2. create a role for aws service as amazons3readonlyaccess just like testing,devlopment (my role name testing)
         
       b. destination account side - 
         1. create a policy with this json policy or script - my policy name is - s3cross

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::520842148501:role/testing"
    }
} 
           
          (arn:aws:iam::520842148501:role/testing - this is source account side role ARN )
          
         
         2. then create iam user with policy permission s3cross. (my user name - s3user)

         3. login s3user (destination iam user)

         4. goto profile section (right top) then switch role (bottom left side)

         5. enter in Account source account number and in role testing*

         6. display name is automatically apear then click switch role.

         7. now you can access source side bucket from destination iam user.

Note- 1. if after this step switch role not perform then doing some step more ---> 
         
      a. go to the source account side and open role (those we create in first step)
      b. then go to the trust relationship then after edit trust policy
      c. then add a principle from below
      d.  then select Principal type - iam users and ARN of iam user from destination side.
      e. after update policy you can access s3 bucket from switch role.
